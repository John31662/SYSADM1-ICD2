# SYSADM1 -- Physical Infrastructure

# Instructions:  {#instructions .list-paragraph}

Answer the following questions based on Week 3 Lecture notes.

1.  Identify potential issues in physical infrastructure setups and
    propose solutions to optimize performance or reduce costs

**Power outages:** Can lead to data loss, system downtime, and
operational disruption.

**Solution:** Implement backup systems and redundant components to
ensure continuity.

**Network congestion:** Can slow down network traffic and impact
application performance.

**Solution:** Monitor network traffic and optimize settings to improve
performance.

**Hardware failures:** Can affect system performance and reliability.

**Solution:** Conduct preventive maintenance to prevent hardware
failures.

2.  You are a project manager responsible for implementing a new
    infrastructure project, such as a smart city initiative or a digital
    transformation strategy.
